An extension for Elementor/Elementor Pro which adds additional functionality for accessibility.

== Description ==

Core A11Y - Accessibility for Elementor is an add-on for sites using the Elementor page builder that adds additional options inside of Elementor's site settings and widget controls to help fix accessibility issues. This plugin is meant to empower Elementor users to be more proactive in editing basic accessibility problems such as missing focus states. 


**Site Settings**

Inside the global site settings, you can set global styles for `:focus-visible` states in the following sections:

*   Buttons
*   Form Fields
*   Typography

**Widgets**

And inside individual widgets, you can override the global `:focus-visible` settings when needed, as well as adjust for other widgets not in the global settings.

* Button
* Call to Action
* Form
* Image
* Testimonial Carousel

**Additional Information**

This plugin will not fix every and all accesibility issues your Elementor site may have - it will only help you adjust the features mentioned above. 

Have a request for a missing feature? Feel free to leave a suggestion in the support forums or email us directly at [support@bnpengage.com](support@bnpengage.com) and we will consider your request.
